Add your icons here!

Create a folder named your github username here. In it create 3 files `128.png` `48.png` `16.png`, the icon/logo in 128x128, 48x48 and 16x16 dimensions respectively. You can even have slightly different icons for each dimensions.

Minimum Design Criteria

The icon/logo should be pleasing to look at and should represent the extension. There should be some effort put into making the logo. Do not copy the entire logo from web. 
Do not pirate the graphics, use free to use graphics from the internet, if needed create an `acknowledgement.txt` if you use any graphics that require acknowledgement from owner to use.
Since design is a subjective task, the final decision to accept or reject a PR, rests with the mentor.
