This folder is for `Open for all: Design the New Tab page` issue.

Make a folder in this named your username and add your design files inside it.

Design files can be anything that can be easily opened without special software. You can also add an `README.md` file to explain your designs. For example if you want the contest details to be revealed when hovering over the timer, then you would ideally add 2 pictures, with the details hidden and shown, along with a README file explaining it.
